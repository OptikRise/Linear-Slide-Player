# Linear-Slide-Player

## Overview
Our Instructional Designers needed a video player that had more control - more specifically a way to control the pace a user has in an activity. This framework became that originally using a standard HTML5 player. The reiteration of this has removed the player and substituted it with our in-house video platform player.

The new version of this framework stemmed from a project request to have a self-paced quiz system. Where an ID could have an informational block/video clip/audio clip/graphic on one slide followed by a quiz related to the previous content on the next slide. This framework auto-grades the users score and will eventually talk back to our LMS via Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI). This addition will come at a later date. 

The work I do is owned by my current employer so this version of the site and code has been altered to hide proprietary information.

Here's what the template looks like live. Again, using Lorem Ipsum to protect my employer's content.
